Create registry of variations of your email to track what sites share your email addresses.

The purpose of this program is to provide a way to track how companies and individuals use and share your email. Not many people know this, but the use of periods in your gmail is completely arbitrary; no matter where you put the periods, the email will reach the same address. However, when you provide a website, company, or individual with your email, they will include the periods in the email. By giving different entities different 'versions' of the same email using different placement of periods, you can track how determine who shared your email when you get an email from an unknown address, or spam.
Disclaimer: Some sites are aware of this and will not accept email addresses that are effectively duplicates.

This will create a base_emails directory in your current directory and create a file for that email.
